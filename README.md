Scallop-TK
==========

The Scalable, Adaptive Localization, and Laplacian Object Proposal
(Scallop) Toolkit is a brief port of some of my master's thesis code
developed at RPI, described further in the paper:

[Automatic Scallop Detection in Benthic Environments](Documentation/Paper.pdf)

It has a few more modern optimizations as well, such as the ability to
run convolutional neural networks on top of the described object
proposal framework. It is useful as a general detector for detecting any
ellipsoidal objects, though it mainly targets benthic organisms such as
clams, scallops, urchins, and others. Also included in the repository is
a frame level classifier aimed at detecting whether or not there are
fish in the image.
