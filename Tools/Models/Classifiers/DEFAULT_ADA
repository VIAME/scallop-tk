; The relative path w.r.t. the root classifier directory, where all of the 
; classifier files below can be found. A slash should be placed at the end.

; A level 1 classifier is applied to all detected interest points
; within an image. Any interest point which passes any one of these
; initial classifiers will have all level 2 (suppressor) classifiers
; applied to it as an additional filter

; Format - Items are stored in a csv list, each list MUST be the same length
;
;          C1IDs - Id of classifier to output if we detect one of these
;                  categories (will appear in output list)
;
;          C1FILES - Classifier filename as it appears in the above subdir
;
;          C1CATEGORY - Does our classifier define one of below special
;                       detection categories?

; Format - Same as above, with an additional C2CLFSTYLE field which should be 
;          labeled as one of the following: WVO, OVO, or MIX for each entry
;
;          Class WVO - A classifier trained on everything (world) vs Distractor
;          Class OVO - Trained on just our Object of Interest vs Distractor
